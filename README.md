## Why EasyECL?
I wanted a tool to mount (and unmount) my container easily.

## Why AutoIT?
It gets the job done easily, and allows for global hotkeys.

## Install
* Create your container by following the instructions at https://blog.persson.im/bitlocker-encrypted-containers
* Change your `$CONTAINERLOCATION` to wherever your container is located.
* Enjoy

## Use
* Click the GUI buttons to **mount** container / **unmount** container / **lock (and unmount** container) your workstation
* **CTRL+ALT+L** (instead of **Winkey+L**) to quickly call LockWorkstation function.
