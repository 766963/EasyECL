## Why EasyECL?
I wanted a tool to mount (and unmount) my container easily.

## Install
* Create your container by following the instructions at https://blog.persson.im/bitlocker-encrypted-containers
* Change your `$CONTAINERLOCATION` to wherever your container is located.
* Enjoy

## Todo
* Add a hotkey for quickly unmounting the container and locking your workstation
